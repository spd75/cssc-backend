# CSSC Backend

This is the repository for the backened development of Cornell Ski and Snowboard Club's website, written in Javascript, using the NodeJS framework. This codebase will allow for users of CSSC-Website to create accounts, sign up for trips, RSVP to events, pay for club dues through a Venmo/Paypal API, and more.  Please excuse any disorganization or incompleteness as this project is still being worked on.
